# Bouncing Ball

This is a my first project I created in MITxpro's course for web development.

It is a bouncing ball that is restricted to the boudaries of the device window, moving on the x and y axis,  
changing color as it bounces on those boundaries. The ball should start moving when the file opens.  

This is still a working progress. I would like to add more features as I progress in learning JavaScript.

I hope you enjoy!
