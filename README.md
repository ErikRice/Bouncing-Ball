# Bouncing Ball

This is one of the first projects I created in MITxpro's course for web development.

It is a bouncing ball that is restricted to the boudaries of the device window, moving on the x and y axis.  
It changes color as it bounces on those boundaries from red to blue. The ball should start moving when the file opens. 



This is still a working progress. I would like to add more features as I progress in learning JavaScript.

I hope you enjoy!
